# what is this?
This is an archive of mod files you'll need to install in order to play on my minecraft server.

# how do I install them?
1. Have a fresh copy of minecraft installed. 
2. Download the latest release from this github page and unpack it.
3. Copy the contents to %appdata%\.minecraft\ (windows) or ~/Library/Application Support/.minecaft/ (mac). ie basically just move the mods folder from the download into your .minecraft folder, or *replace* the contents of an existing mods folder with this one.
3. Download forge version 1.12.2 from https://files.minecraftforge.net/ and run the installer to patch minecraft with the forge modding api.
4. In the minecraft launcher, switch over to the 'launch options' tab, click 'add new' to make a new launch profile, name it something intuitive like 'forge 1.12.2', and pick the 'release 1.12.2-forge' option from the version drop down. Save the profile.
5. Switch back to the 'news' table, select your new profile using the little carat button next to the 'play' button, and the click the 'play' button to launch your modded minecraft.

# ok now how do I connect to your server in minecraft?
Ask me in discord, I'm not sharing the address publically.
